    * reordered Makefile.am so that it always includes
    tclshrl.c,wishrl.c into the distribution.

    * reenabled wishrl and tclshrl via configure switches

2000-11-19  Johannes Zellner  <johannes@zellner.org>

    * configure.in: moved the tlib check before the libreadline check

2000-09-20  Johannes Zellner <johannes@zellner.org>

    * made tclreadline.h installing to ${prefix}/include

2000-08-27  Johannes Zellner <johannes@zellner.org>

    * added Mark to AUTHORS :)

    * converted tclreadline::readline to be an object
    command. This was the simplest way to fix the
    Tcl_Obj mem leak.

    * added the command readline text and readline update
    that retrieve the current input and redraw it respecively.

     * configure.in: changed a == to = in a sh test
     (reported by "Daniel O'Connor" <darius@dons.net.au>)

2000-07-03  Johannes Zellner <johannes@zellner.org>

     * Makefile.am: included EXTRA_DIST so that it compiles from `dist'

2000-07-01  Johannes Zellner <johannes@zellner.org>

     * switched to automake
     * small fix so that itcl config switches are correctly completed.
